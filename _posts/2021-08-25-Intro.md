Hi! there. 

I am Korean, living in Seoul for almost 40 years.   
I can say I am Very normal person, the average Korean. (NOT homeowner)   
As a monthly paid employee with 15days sick leave credits a year, I always dream about ideal retirement.   
   
I have diverse overseas experiences ;    
6months in Chicago-USA, 2years in Laos, 2years in Beijing-China, business trips to Bangladesh, Saudi, Pakistan, Brazil, Mexico, Iran, Turkey etc..   

Foreigners don't know Korea well but they know Samsung smarphone, LG electronics, BTS and Kim Jeung Eun (King of secret kingdom).
