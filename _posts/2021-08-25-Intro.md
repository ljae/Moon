Hi! there. 

I am Korean, living in Seoul for almost 40 years.   
I can say I am Very normal average Korean.
As a monthly paid employee with 15days sick leave credits a year, I always dream about wealthy retirement.   
   
I have diverse overseas experiences ;    
6months in Chicago-USA, 2years in Laos, 2years in Beijing-China, business trips to Bangladesh, Saudi, Pakistan, Brazil, Mexico, Iran, Turkey etc..   

This diverse experience makes me to write a blog about Korea, my lovely country but sometimes very misterious at the same time. 
Foreigners don't know Korea well but they have heard about Samsung smarphone, LG electronics, BTS and Kim Jeung Eun (King of secret north kingdom).    
I want to describe a specific theme generally with public statistics data analysis and will jump to personal experience or my won thought.   

Thanks for visit.
