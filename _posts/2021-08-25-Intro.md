Hi! there. 

*I am Korean, living in Seoul for almost 40 years.*
I can say I am Very normal person, the average Korean.
Working in a company, I get a monthly pay with 15days sick leave credits a year. 

I have diverse overseas experiences ; 6 months in Chicago-USA, 2 years in Laos, 2 years in Beijing-China, business trips to Bangladesh, Saudi, Pakistan, Brazil, Mexico, Iran, Turkey etc..

Foreigners don't know Korea well but they know Samsung smarphone, LG electronics, BTS and Kim Jeung Eun (King of secret kingdom)
