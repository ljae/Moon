Hi! there.    

I am Korean, living in Seoul for almost 40 years.   
I can say I am a Very ordinary Korean.   
As a monthly paid employee with 15days of sick leave credits a year, I always dream about wealthy retirement.   
   
I have diverse overseas experiences.    
Chicago for 6months, Laos for 2years, Beijing for 2years, business trips to Bangladesh, Saudi, Pakistan, Brazil, Mexico, Iran, Turkey, etc...   

This diverse experience makes me writing a blog about Korea, my lovely country.   
Foreigners like to ask about products or famous persons from Korea, such as Samsung smartphones, LG electronics, BTS,
BlackPink and sometimes Kim Jeung Eun.
However, they don't understand Korea. They even couldn't differentiate between South Korea and North Korea.    
One of the questions they ask is "Are you from North or South?"   
After understanding Korea a little bit more, they could get an insight into what makes "made-in-Korea" products & culture.   

I want to describe a specific theme generally with public statistics data analysis and will jump to personal experience or my own thought on this blog.   

I will write in English in this blog even though I am not good at it.   

Because     
Kids always follow their parents.   
I hope my kids do their best to be good at speaking English, being a global citizen. 

Let's go on a trip.   

Thanks for your visit. Sorry for my ugly English.
