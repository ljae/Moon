Hi! there.    

I am Korean, living in Seoul for almost 40 years.   
I can say I am a Very normal average Korean.   
As a monthly paid employee with 15days of sick leave credits a year, I always dream about wealthy retirement.   
   
I have diverse overseas experiences ;    
6months in Chicago-USA, 2years in Laos, 2years in Beijing-China, business trips to Bangladesh, Saudi, Pakistan, Brazil, Mexico, Iran, Turkey, etc..   

This diverse experience makes me writing a blog about Korea, my lovely country.   
But sometimes very mysterious events take place here.        
Foreigners don't know Korea well but they have heard about Samsung smartphones, LG electronics, BTS, and Kim Jeung Eun (King of the secret north kingdom).    
After understanding Korea a little bit more, they could get an insight into what makes "made-in-Korea" products & culture.   

I want to describe a specific theme generally with public statistics data analysis and will jump to personal experience or my own thought on this blog.   

Let's go to trip.   

Thanks for your visit.
